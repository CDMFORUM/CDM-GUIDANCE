# CDM-GUIDANCE

The purpose of the CDM Forum is discussion related to CDM interpretation and implementation. We hope to connect people in different networks who may have similar challenges.

This guidance repository contains materials intended to support these implementation efforts by data partners, including suggestions, recommendations, and best practices.
